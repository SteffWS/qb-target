## Overview
qb-target is a targeting solution that allows interaction with any predefined entity, model, entity type or polyzone. While activated you can easily and safely replace markers and distance checking, instead relying on intuitive design to improve player experiences and optimize interaction.

## Installation
1. Drag and drop the `css, js & index.html` folder/files into your qb-target `html` folder

2. Just save the icons yourself, and try get it working with whatever target you use

## Requirements
- [PolyZone](https://github.com/mkafrin/PolyZone) by mkafrin
- [qb-target](https://github.com/nemaDev/qb-target) by nemaDev

- If you are already using a different target script that you prefer, you might be able to simply replace the HTML folder in that script with the files from this repository. However, this approach hasn't been fully tested, so results may vary.

## Acknowledgments
